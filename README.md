# NodeRestAPI

This project is a first approach to a REST API using NodeJS, MongoDB and Express (no Angular yet). 

This will be used with educational purposes.

In order to run the app you will need at least:

- NodeJS
- MongoDB

Remember to update your npm before running and do not forget to run the MongoDB daemon (mongod) during the execution of your app.
